	<h2>skills</h2>

	<div align="justify">
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>In my skills</strong>, I know how to handle my time I always 
	come to my classes at 6 am.<sup>1</sup> That's one hour before my class starts.<sup>2</sup> I need to travel as early as possible to 
	avoid traffic.<sup>3</sup> I have common sense when it comes to things and I can also motivate myself when I'm feeling down.<sup>4</sup>
	<strong>One of the greatest skills that I have recognized</strong> would have to be my ability to be <b><i><u>flexible</b></i></u> in all things and 
	circumstances.<sup>5</sup> My ability to operate in a team has been honed since I was a child.<sup>6</sup> Nonetheless, performing group 
	presentations and tasks with my classmates has helped.<sup>7</sup> I feel that forming teams can result in more timely and efficient 
	outputs as well as improved <b><i><u>decision-making</b></i></u> abilities.<sup>8</sup> In terms of career advancement, there are a variety of benefits 
	to working in a team.<sup>9</sup> The qualities and abilities that enable you to work well with others during conversations, projects, 
	meetings, and other collaborations are known as teamwork skills.<sup>10</sup> The ability to <b><i><u>communicate effectively</b></i></u>, actively listen, 
	and be responsible and honest are all required for effective teamwork.<sup>11</sup> Practicing honesty is also one of my skills.<sup>12</sup> 
	Working through a conflict, explaining why you weren't able to complete a task on time, or delivering uncomfortable 
	updates are all examples of honesty and transparency at the assignment.<sup>13</sup> Without openness, it can be difficult for a 
	team to build trust and, as a result, operate well together.<sup>14</sup> Communication can be also a skill.<sup>15</sup> Why? Because <b><i><u>communication 
	is my basis for any success.</b></i></u><sup>16</sup> When we're given a certain task at school communication is the best key to executing these 
	tasks as a team or group.<sup>17</sup> You also need to cooperate as a student we can't always we will not succeed if we are always alone.<sup>18</sup>
	In sports, I am proud to say that when I was in high school I was a badminton player.<sup>19</sup> I also play musical instruments like drums, guitar, 
	piano, and so on.<sup>20</sup>All of these helped me to hone my skills and also become a better person.<sup>21</sup>

	<h2>hobbies</h2>
	<div align="right">
	<p><blockquote>My hobbies are so many if you don't ask. First, I play a lot of <b>computer games.</b><sup>1</sup> All kinds of
		game, I'm pretty sure I have tried it already.<sup>2</sup> With this hobby of mine I'm always playing with the
		boys cause they also love to play computer games, right?<sup>3</sup> They are also my friends when I was in 
		highschool we used to play computer games before we enter our school.<sup>4</sup> Isn't crazy? But I never let
		this to become an obstruction to my studies.<sup>5</sup> We will only play if we have spare time before class starts.<sup>6</sup>
		I also love to go to the beach with my family.<sup>7</sup> Our favorite beach is in Dasol, Pangasinan.<sup>8</sup> Our travel 
		time is 5-7 hours because I think Dasol is 2nd farthest place in Pangasinan.<sup>9</sup> My cousin's husband is from
		Pangasinan so we have a place there.<sup>10</sup> I like to swim at night sometimes, I also love to go to the deep parts
		of the beach cause it's fun for me because I know how to swim.<sup>11</sup> One of my hobbies is also <strong>listening to music.<sup>12</sup>
		<i><u>No music, no life.</i></u></strong><sup>13</sup> I love listening to music because I can feel the lyrics to my soul.<sup>14</sup> Well it depends on 
		the genre of the music the deeper the lyrics the more it hurts.<sup>15</sup> My friends and I also love to go hangout
		we drink sometimes.<sup>16</sup> We just spend our time together we talk and laugh about things.<sup>17</sup> I have a friend of mine
		who loves to go to concerts and I also love to go.<sup>18</sup> Every year, we attend to this Music Festival called <strong>Hydro
		Manila it was held in Mall of Asia, Pasay City.</strong><sup>19</sup> There are bands who will perform their music or album and 
		there's water in the concert they will splash you with water.<sup>20</sup> Playing badminton is my favorite hobby.<sup>21</sup>
		Sports can help you work with your body to be physically fit.<sup>22</sup> During lunch break we play badminton on the court
		and it was so fun especially when you were playing with your friends and classmates.<sup>23</sup>

	<h2>interests</h2>
	<p><dd>Interests are subjects that fascinate you and want to learn more about.<sup>1</sup> Learning and discovering ideas, concepts, 
		and knowledge, such as history, animal behavior, or even pop culture, is a common interest.<sup>2</sup> <strong>I want to know a lot 
		about programming.</strong><sup>3</sup> I am a 2nd year college student from University of The East - Manila.<sup>4</sup> <strong>I am currently taking Bachelor of 
		Science in Information Technology (BSIT)</strong>because I want to learn how to code, how to understand the code and how it works.<sup>5</sup>
		I also want to create and run my own program in the future.<sup>6</sup> That is why I am studying now and <strong>I am thankful to have
		professors that are very kind professional in the field of IT.</strong><sup>7</sup> When I was in senior high, I took Accountancy and Business
		Management (ABM). At first, I thought it was very easy to learn.<sup>8</sup> Before I went to senior high I didn't know what I wanted
		so I just chose ABM.<sup>9</sup> I learned how to balance, how to compute for depreciation expense for a company.<sup>10</sup> There are things that 
		I still have to learn and also things that I wanted to learn.<sup>11</sup> I have always wanted to try to volunteer in any community service
		in our barangay.<sup>12</sup> I tried it once but I don't remember it at all I'm just a kid when that was happened.<sup>13</sup> Learning different kinds of
		languages is also one of my interests.<sup>14</sup> I already knew some basic Ilocano, Pangalatok, and Bisaya.<sup>15</sup> I am really enjoying to watch
		people talking using their own dialect.<sup>16</sup> They have their own pronounciation of their words and sometimes it's funny.<sup>17</sup>
		I've always wanted to try climbing on mountains my friends and I are planning to climb.<sup>18</sup>
