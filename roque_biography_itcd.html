	<h3><i><strike>Childhood Years</strike></i></h3>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my <b><i><u>childhood years</u></i></b>, that was the time I don't care about a lot of things.<sup>1</sup> I am enjoying my life
		to the fullest.<sup>2</sup>I always play outside with my friends and come home late because of that.<sup>3</sup> Sometimes
		I got angry with my parents because when I want something I couldn't get what I want like toys.<sup>4</sup>
		My parents were separated since I was a kid.<sup>5</sup> I saw them argue and it hurts to see that happen 
		right in front of me.<sup>6</sup> I don't have many childhood memories because childhood is the one that reminds me of how my parents were 
		separated.<sup>7</sup> All I can do is enjoy things.<sup>8</sup> I admit that I still thought about the things that happened in the past
		but I guess that will be good for them.<sup>9</sup> Oh, I remember I had a dog well it's just a stuff toy but I could'nt sleep when it's not beside me.<sup>10</sup>
		One day, it just disappeared out of nowhere.<sup>11</sup> Every time I remember that stuff toy I feel sad.<sup>12</sup></div></p>

	<h3><i>Teenage Years</i></h3>	
	<div align = "center">
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<blockquote>During my <b><i><u>teenage years</tt></u></i></b>, when I got to high school my parents transferred me to another school.<sup>1</sup>
		I didn't like that school at all because people there are very proud of themselves to the point
		that if they don't like you they will bully you.<sup>2</sup> I got bullied by the people there especially the boys.<sup>3</sup>
		I was on the last section so what to expect? <strong>In this stage, I started to have depression.</strong><sup>4</sup>
		Always sad for no reason, I feel like I'm always alone.<sup>5</sup> I feel like people are always talking behind my back.<sup>6</sup>
		<strong><i>Despite all this, I still have good friends but the rest of them don't understand me.</strong></i><sup>7</sup> I appreciate it when
		people invite me to eat outside or in the canteen.<sup>8</sup> When I was in my 3rd year, I applied for MOCC.<sup>9</sup> It's a thing similar to CAT
		you will have training in the morning.<sup>10</sup> I came here to lose my focus on my bully classmates.<sup>11</sup> We should be at the school
		before 5 am.<sup>12</sup> We should complete our tasks at school like we need to help kids to carry their bags upstairs.<sup>13</sup> After our
		classes, we had to train from 3 pm to 5 pm.<sup>14</sup> This helps us to improve our stamina it's like a battery test you are required to do
		some pushups, squats, and situps.<sup>15</sup> We called our seniors officer Sir/Ma'am.<sup>16</sup> They will also teach you how to assemble and
		disassemble a riffle.<sup>17</sup> Some officers are rude because we need to be disciplined.<sup>18</sup> After we graduated from MOCC, I became
		an officer and I am the one who leads our CAT in school.<sup>19</sup> I trained all 4th-year female students.<sup>20</sup> I like what I am doing 
		during those days.<sup>21</sup> Even though I had bad days there are always good days.<sup>22</sup></blockquote></div></p>

	<h3><i><tt>College Years</tt></i></h3>
	<div align = "right">
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<blockquote><b><i><u><dd>College years</b></i></u>, I met so many amazing people who appreciate me.<sup>1</sup> I am so happy that I met those people
		I thought no one is going to recognize me at all.<sup>2</sup> It all started when I entered UE in senior high school.<sup>3</sup>
		I have encountered many different people who came from other schools.<sup>4</sup> My friends are so important to me even though
		we are in different schools now we still keep in touch.<sup>5</sup> We still go outside, eat, talk a lot.<sup>6</sup> Our hobby is to
		always talk in the hallway of UE when it's lunch break.<sup>7</sup> We don't usually eat as the others do.<sup>8</sup> We just want
		to spend our time laughing and talking.<sup>9</sup> I have a friend whose name is Aubrey but she moved to Oman now.<sup>10</sup>
		She's a reliable friend and she's also a talented singer, good at table tennis she was a UAAP Player back then.<sup>11</sup>
		She's always there for me when I have a problem with my family.<sup>12</sup> I'm so excited to see her and meet her again.<sup>13</sup>
		During our 12th grade one of our subjects we are required to sell something because we're ABM students.<sup>14</sup>
		So we came up with a bracelet and morse code.<sup>15</sup> It's called morsette, for example, you want your name we are going to 
		convert it into morse code, and then we're going to create a bracelet with your name but in morse code.<sup>16</sup> We sell every 
		day at the POD building creating them is very tiring especially when we got so many orders.<sup>17</sup> There are so many processes 
		before you can sell and create those bracelets.<sup>18</sup> Our sales reached almost 25,000 pesos we are all very happy about the 
		success of our business.<sup>19</sup> My shs journey has been very exciting it will always be.<sup>20</sup> I hope that this pandemic has come to an end.<sup>21</sup>
		We all want to meet or <kbd>bond with</kbd> our friends as soon as possible.</blockquote></dd><sup>22</sup></div></p>
